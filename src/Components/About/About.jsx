            <h5>The Ntel Story</h5>
            <p>The beginning of the ntel story can be traced to the acquisition of core telecom assets previously owned by Nigeria’s national fixed and mobile operators- NiTel/MTel- by NatCom Development & Investment Ltd. (NatCom) in a liquidation process supervised and approved by Nigeria’s Bureau of Public Enterprises and a court-appointed liquidator. This liquidation process was concluded in May, 2015 with the following NiTel/MTel core assets wholly transferred to NatCom:</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h5>Operating Licenses:</h5>
            <p>National carrier, international gateway and mobile.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h5>Spectrum:</h5>
            <p>Cellular on 900/1800/1900 MHz and shared microwave</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h5>Our Offerings: Total Telecoms</h5>
            <p>ntel’s LTE Advanced network is designed on 900/1800 Mhz frequency bands which, in combination with Carrier Aggregation and Multiple Antennae (4X4) technology, enable maximum and average throughput rates of 230Mbps and 60Mbps respectively. Our ‘total telecoms’ approach to service delivery affords us 360-degree touchpoints to cater to our customers’ needs. Specifically, we offer:</p>

            <br/>
            <p>The name ‘ntel’ is the brand name under which NatCom trades. Although trade is currently limited to 3 of Nigeria’s largest commercial cities: Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt, there are already plans in motion to expand to more cities and meet our projected coverage of 85% of mobile broadband spending within 3 years and about 95% within 5 years.
On Monday, January 18, 2016, ntel initiated a new beginning in Nigeria’s telecoms industry by making its first on-net test data call in Lagos. This landmark event was followed by the first Voice over LTE (VoLTE) call in Lagos on Thursday, February 25, 2016 achieved in partnership with Original Equipment Manufacturers, Ericsson of Sweden and Sony Mobile of Japan. Since then, further VoLTE calls have been successfully completed with Samsung Electronics of South Korea, ZTE of China and Tecno of Nigeria.
